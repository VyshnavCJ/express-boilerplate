## Boilerplate generator for Node.js, Express

I used to find myself copy-pasting the same directory and file structures over and over again. So, I created this simple node express boilerplate generator to ease the task. I acknowledge, there are so many better and advanced tools for this task, but I wanted to build something custom while learning something new :)

## Installation

Install node-expressgen with npm globally

```bash
  npm install node-expressgen -g
```

## Usage/Examples

Once you installed it globally, just type this command where you want to generate the boilerplate.

```bash
express-boil

```

It will prompt a question, asking you for project name.

```bash
? Project name: <Enter your project name here>
```

And boom!! you have your node express boilerplate
